# Introduction 

Working at Lystup Maher has been one of the foundation points of my career as an engineer. Lystrup Maher is an engineering consulting company that specializes in making aircraft lighter, faster, and stronger. I started as an intern near the end of March, and have since worked on a very large variety of projects with almost as many companies. The work I have done is listed beneath the company names below. I started this internship as a developing engineer. Each of the projects I have worked on have provided critical lessons for me to implement as I strive to become the best engineer I can be.

- [iDOP](#idop)
- [CFX Technologies](#cfx-technologies)
- [CTE Engine Compnay](#cte-engine-company)
