                A while back, I had came across a large number of people with knee pain.
            The more people with joint pain whom I came in contact with, the more I thought about
            how pervailent knee problems are. This got me thinking, what causes knee pain?
            Is it the way a person walks? Does stepping with more force contribute to knee
            issues, or is it how fast the a foot goes from stepping to stopping.
