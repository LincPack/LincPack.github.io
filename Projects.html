        <p>
            I've always been interested in exploring different
            questions, so I have many concurrent projects. My wife
            has been very supportive as I've spent long hours on online 
            searches and in my lab working away on some interesting thing I've been
            wanting to make, or a question I've been wanting to Answer.
